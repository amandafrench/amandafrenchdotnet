It is an explanation of why regular people think philosophers (e.g., Plato and Socrates) are crazy: the regular people are stuck on the notion that what they think is real is in fact real, they can't appreciate the reality that the philosopher appreciates, and the philosopher finds it very hard to explain this other reality to them and anyway is not very motivated to do so. The allegory of the cave is a thought experiment, a parable, a myth, and a theory about the nature of reality, and it's also just an enduringly intriguing scene to try to visualize, as <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://platosallegory.com">the terrific short film we've just watched</a> shows. &#13;
&#13;
But it's also a story, a narrative, and as such it has a form, a structure: that two-thousand-four-hundred-year-old structure, I'd like to point out, is an extremely common one in the contemporary genre known as fantasy. And, of course, if that structure is common in fantasy, it's common in science fiction as well. &#13;
&#13;
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="anthologize-image-wrapper"><img src="BH-03.png" alt="Fantasy and Science Fiction" title="Fantasy and Science Fiction" width="384" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-582"/></div>&#13;
&#13;
When you think about it, it's a bit odd that bookstores lump together science fiction and fantasy. Science fiction is very much about technology, and generally involves the construction of a future or alternate world whose chief characteristic is advanced technology; the accompanying narrative usually explores the problems and opportunities of that technology. Fantasy, in apparent contrast, involves the construction of an alternate world that more or less resembles the Middle Ages, a world entirely without technology. The universes of the fantasy genre, however, have magic, and, as Arthur C. Clarke famously <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_sufficiently_advanced_technology_is_indistinguishable_from_magic">said</a> in his 1958 work <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/profiles-of-the-future/oclc/15994040">Profiles of the Future</a>, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." The common factor in fantasy and science fiction, of course, is that creation of an alternate world, a world that is recognizably not this one.&#13;
&#13;
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="anthologize-image-wrapper"><img src="BH-04.png" alt="World One and World Zero" title="World One and World Zero" width="384" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-589"/></div>&#13;
&#13;
Plato's allegory of the cave, like science fiction and fantasy, also posits an alternate world, a world that is recognizably not this one. In its narrative structure, there are two worlds, and the hero is the only person (or almost the only person) who can travel between those two worlds. I have named these worlds World One and World Zero, names which correspond to the visible world and the invisible world. We need to avoid the term "the real world," because it's often precisely the question of which world is more real (not to mention which world is better) that is at issue. In Plato's allegory, the dark cave with its flickerings is an image of World One, the visible world, the world of limited ordinary perception; while the dazzling world of sunflare and shadow is World Zero, the nonexistent, absent, invisible world, the exotic extraordinary other world of pure thought, which the philosopher hero tries and inevitably fails to describe to the chained inhabitants of World One. &#13;
&#13;
There are plenty of sci-fi/fantasy narratives that have exactly this structure: ordinary World One, exotic World Zero, and a hero who travels between them. I've listed some, but I'm sure you can name others.&#13;
&#13;
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="anthologize-image-wrapper"><img src="BH-05.png" alt="List" title="List " width="384" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-584"/></div>&#13;
&#13;
In these narratives, the alternate world might be an island, say. Or it might be another planet. Or it might be an alternate dimension accessible through a portal in this world. Or it might be an alternate time, either in the present or the past. Or it might be a spiritual realm. Or it might be a dream, or an illusion -- this often turns out to be the case for narratives in which the hero is a woman, as for instance <!-- copied at 1 --><em><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/55">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> and (the original) <!-- copied at 1 --><em><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11">Alice in Wonderland</a></em>, stories in which women can have adventures only if they are not real adventures. World Zero, in short, is a secret or hidden or inaccessible or invisible world constituted by its apparent non-existence. Some sci-fi/fantasy narratives not listed here, of course, simply set up an alternate World Zero and allow whatever world actually surrounds the reader or audience to serve as the visible World One, and we ourselves become the hero who has experience of both. But here I am concerned primarily with narratives that explicitly represent two worlds and are explicitly engaged with the contrast between them.&#13;
&#13;
So if that's the case, if Plato's allegory is in many ways a sort of proto-fantasy/sci-fi story, what does it all (as they say) mean? &#13;
&#13;
Well, one question worth pursuing is this one: Which world is the digital world?&#13;
&#13;
I don't know about you, but I sometimes worry that I spend too much time looking at screens: computer screens, smartphone screens, TV screens, movie theater screens, and (of course) screens on which slides are projected. Am I cutting myself off from the real world? Am I insufficiently mindful and overly mediated? Am I, in short, watching "shadows of artefacts" all day long, just like the prisoners in Plato's cave? There are plenty of people who would say Yes, yes you are, you and all those other SXSW attendees. Get out of the dark cave of your parents' basement, nerd, and get some sunshine. Stop with the fantasy already. Writers like <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/cult-of-the-amateur-how-todays-internet-is-killing-our-culture/oclc/78774488">Andrew Keen</a> and <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="p://www.worldcat.org/title/shallows-what-the-internet-is-doing-to-our-brains/oclc/449865498">Nicholas Carr</a> and (most recently) <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/you-are-not-a-gadget-a-manifesto/oclc/297147711">Jaron Lanier</a> bring us a version of this message, a version which is often more complicated and careful and sometimes even caring than I've made it sound here, and their books do well here at SXSW. These thinkers seem to fit neatly into the role Plato ascribes to the philosopher: he who stays with the cave-dwellers in order to do the hard work of convincing them to cease investing so much in mere shadows of artefacts, the hard work of "turning the mind as a whole away from the world of becoming, until it becomes capable of bearing the sight of real being and reality at its most bright" (<!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/republic/oclc/27012167">Waterfield</a> 245).&#13;
&#13;
Yet Plato's allegory of the cave need not be a touchstone only for anti-mediationists. That philosopher figure, trying vainly to explain the workings of the unseen world to those who do not understand, is also a highly resonant figure for the technologist. Anyone who's done even the mildest form of tech support can relate to the communication barrier that Plato's philosopher experiences, that sense of trying to explain sunshine to the benighted, whereas even the Luddiest Luddite can't accuse any of the screen people of never once having experienced the Luddite version of unmediated reality. But if you've coded, you've experienced a world of pure logic that others haven't. Similarly, a Twitter fan like me certainly feels that there's a reality to that world that people who "don't get" Twitter (and have therefore never used it) have no access to. Plenty of popular World One World Zero narratives simply scorn the Muggle World One and meander through the luxurious specs of its own particular techno-magical World Zero. &#13;
&#13;
World One World Zero narratives, including Plato's allegory of the cave, often turn out to be perfectly flexible on the "is tech good or is it bad" question. The most popular and enduring narratives are always those, I verily believe, in which we get to have it both ways: we get to enjoy our technology and our fears about technology at the same time, just as, in the <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Wizard of Oz</em>, we get to enjoy Dorothy's adventures while ultimately being assured that her true place is at home. Anything else is probably too simplistic to hold our interest for long. Only those who might arguably be spending too much time with screens are interested in horror stories about spending too much time with screens. &#13;
&#13;
Some of the most quintessentially geeky fantasies have an apparently anti-fantasy moral, <!-- copied at 1 --><em><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a></em> being certainly a much more interesting example than <!-- copied at 1 --><em><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0986263/">Surrogates</a></em>. In <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://my.sxsw.com/events/event/867">his talk yesterday</a>, Jaron Lanier recommended a 1909 sci-fi story by E. M. Forster, "<!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/prajlich/forster.html">The Machine Stops</a>," as a story with exactly the same message: it is bad to live in the mediated world, however pleasant: it is good to live in the real world, however difficult. (This, by the way, is not precisely Lanier's argument in his recent manifesto <!-- copied at 1 --><em><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/you-are-not-a-gadget-a-manifesto/oclc/297147711">You Are Not a Gadget</a></em>: he is, after all, the father of virtual reality. Much of his concern about today's Internet is that it is insufficiently fantastic, that it lacks the fluidity and weirdness it once had, that the mediated world is now a suburb where it was once a phantasmagoria.) It's always remarkably easy for fantasy to be anti-fantasy without, apparently, causing us much cognitive dissonance. Plato's allegory of the cave, that remarkably imaginative story, is only one small part of the utopian narrative <!-- copied at 1 --><em><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/republic/oclc/27012167">The Republic</a></em>, elsewhere in which Plato famously banned the poets, the dramatists, the imagineers from his ideal community. &#13;

&#13;
Similarly, James Cameron uses famously advanced cinematic technology in order to create narratives that apparently warn strongly against technology. Historically, the moral of the unsinkable Titanic has always been that man puts too much faith in technology, but the meta-narrative of Cameron's movie <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Titanic</em> is as technologically idolatrous as ever -- so long as that technology is used in the service of storytelling. The story of <!-- copied at 1 --><em><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/">Avatar</a></em> is the story of a man who abandons a familiar modern mechanistic world in order to wear a loincloth and fly dragons, and yet surely not a single person who saw the film (3-D or otherwise) failed to discuss the film's inviting technological innovation and exciting technological expense. To traverse the green jungle of Pandora is to become a part of the computational sublime. Stories such as <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Avatar</em> and <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Dune</em> and <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Star Wars</em> (I'm talking about the original, the New Hope, here) that narrate a competition for protagonist mindshare between the futuristic technology of science fiction and the primitive mysticism of fantasy inevitably come down on the side of the spiritual, the ineffable, the magical. Neo discovers that he is the One. Luke turns off his targeting computer and scores a bullseye by trusting the Force. Jake Sully transcends the turbocharged tanning bed that puts him into the body of his avatar with the help of a mystical tree. It doesn't matter. Through the power of metaphor, when magic wins, technology wins. It's not so much that the technology is indistinguishable from magic as that the magic is indistinguishable from technology. For this reason, I think, even these apparently anti-fantasy, anti-mediation, anti-technology stories are beloved by we screen people, we people of the screen. &#13;
&#13;
I am going to go out on a limb here (though not literally, like Jake Sully), and say straight out that <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Avatar</em> is a bad movie. It was fine, it was entertaining, I enjoyed it, I went to see it with my brother and enjoyed spending that time with him, but without getting solemn or hysterical about it, I'll still propose that it is a bad movie. It is a bad movie because it goes a bit too far over that "having it both ways" line, that line that separates the paradoxical from the hypocritical. Put it this way: if I take Jake Sully as my model, what sort of real-world action or belief does that translate into for me? Pandora's jungle has a sort of real world visual equivalent in, say, the disappearing Brazilian rainforest, but <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Avatar</em> is clearly not recommending that we go primitive. On Pandora, all creatures are designed with organic USB cables, and Pandora itself is repeatedly troped as a network. ("It's a network," explains Jake Sully.) The harsh truth is that computers are not at all "green" (Google the carbon footprint of Google sometime), and that by participating in the network we know, we are putting our own planet's lush jungles in danger. &#13;
&#13;
Better versions of the World One World Zero narrative have a legitimate and balanced argument  that stands up to scrutiny once we strip out the allegory, the metaphor. Plato, for instance, is arguing both that regular people should trust philosophers when philosophers say that there's a different way of looking at things and that philosophers should keep on striving to explain their different way of looking at things to people who have good reason for their lack of comprehension. That remains good counsel both for people who call tech support and for people who provide tech support.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
But it's not just a problem with <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Avatar</em>; it's a bit of a problem with the binary structure of the World One World Zero narrative itself and the egocentrism involved in relating to the single hero (or elite few) who can travel between those two worlds. The best science fiction and fantasy narratives, whether on screen or in print, often refuse or alter or complicate (or we might say, "deconstruct") this compelling structure, just as Randall Bennett's xkcd comic famously shows us the limitations of <!-- copied at 1 --><em>The Matrix</em>'s logic. &#13;
&#13;
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="anthologize-image-wrapper"><img src="BH-07.png" alt="Buffy, Normal Again" title="Buffy, Normal Again" width="384" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-580"/></div>&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><em><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>, for instance, not only alters the gender of the hero, but also makes sure that the narrative and the meta-narrative are in sync: we're never allowed to forget that the Buffyverse is above all allegorical. The ordinary world and the extraordinary world are <!-- copied at 1 --><em>the same</em>, in other words, not opposed at all. The demons, Joss Whedon repeatedly makes clear, are Buffy's demons. We do enjoy it on the literal level, of course: there are literally kick-ass martial arts fights. But Whedon entrusts us to remember the metaphor, so that watching Buffy is always to be aware that you are watching a story that tells you baldly, if allegorically: women are strong, in all possible ways. The episode of <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Buffy</em> called <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0533464/">"Normal Again"</a> posits with unsettlingly convincing logic that Buffy may simply be psychotic, schizophrenic, that the demons she fights are simply the product of her own disordered brain. But, ultimately, Buffy the heroine and <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Buffy</em> the series firmly refuse the "it was all a dream" gambit that made the turn-of-the-century <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Wizard of Oz</em> and <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Alice and Wonderland</em> safe for popular consumption. And the series ended (at least on television, though it continues as a graphic novel) by happily robbing Buffy of her superhero singularity, distributing the special abilities normally reserved for a protagonist to a whole passel of potential heros.&#13;

&#13;
Any why only two worlds? Why not many? The structure of the classic Star Trek posits dozens or hundreds or thousands or millions of different worlds, not simply two. Moreover, of course, it was a multiethnic team who visited these worlds: the clear allegorical meaning of Star Trek was always that different cultures are to be explored and understood, not demeaned and demonized. My housemate in graduate school was a linguist in the Anthropology department, and he often taught the episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation called <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708696/">"Darmok,"</a> in which Picard attempts to understand the language of a radically different culture, a culture whose elliptical language could only be understood by learning their history. &#13;

&#13;
Or why have a single hero at all? Why not many? If you like science fiction and fantasy, as I do (which I hope is clear), you may well love postmodern novels, some of which use the conventions of science fiction and fantasy but play with narrative structure. I highly recommend David Mitchell's <!-- copied at 1 --><em><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/cloud-atlas-a-novel/oclc/53919721">Cloud Atlas</a></em>, for instance, which consists of six separate interwoven stories. As soon as one narrative is half-told, it breaks off and another begins. We begin by hearing the story of a doctor on a nineteenth century sea voyage to Malaysia, go through several <!-- copied at 1 --><em>almost</em> unrelated stories until we arrive at a typically sci-fi dystopian future in which a slave clone tells the story of her spiritual awakening. Only then do we begin to get the end of every story in reverse chronological order, until finally we're back in the nineteenth century, understanding at last just how all six of these worlds and their six trapped heroes are connected. &#13;

&#13;
Or consider David Foster Wallace's <!-- copied at 1 --><em><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/infinite-jest-a-novel/oclc/32738491">Infinite Jest</a></em>, a novel that has a well-deserved reputation as a difficult masterpiece of postmodern literature, but which is also a highly readable tragicomic piece of science fiction set in a dystopian near-future America with herds of feral hamsters and giant fans blowing airborne pollution north to Canada. <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Infinite Jest</em>'s structure is famously complex, which is part of the fun of reading it: <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://kottke.org/07/12/infinite-jest">Michael Silverblatt once hesitantly remarked to the author</a> that the novel seemed to him to be "written in fractals," to which Wallace replied, "I've heard you were an acute reader. That's one of the things, structurally, that's going on. It's actually structured like something called a Sierpinski Gasket, which is a very primitive kind of pyramidal fractal." James Cameron's movies pretty much suggest that mechanical technology (ships, tanks) is totally harsh while narrative technology (CGI, 3-D) is totally awesome, but David Foster Wallace's writings suggest, much more delicately and persuasively and fractally, that narrative technology might be a bit of a problem -- all narrative technology, up to and including the most basic gears and pulleys of narrative itself. To put it bluntly, <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Infinite Jest</em> makes you desperately want to find out what happened and then refuses to tell you what happened. As Kathleen Fitzpatrick <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/requiescat-in-pace/">has put it</a>, <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Infinite Jest</em> strongly hints that "whatever answers we're seeking won't be found in the text, but in the world beyond." &#13;
&#13;
The world beyond: whichever world that may be. &#13;
&#13;
We create worlds and universes so easily now: the blogosphere, the Twitterverse, Oz, Narnia, Middle Earth, Pandora. That term "information superhighway" sounds quaint these days at least in part because a highway traverses at the very most a continent, a laughably small territory to ascribe to the Internet. There are never only two worlds and there is never only one hero who has lived in both: that was as true for Plato as it is for us, if we can only remember it.</p></div></div><div class="library-item"><h3 class="library-item-title">For Veterans' Day: On John McCrae's "In Flanders Fields"</h3><div class="library-item-content"><!-- copied at 1 --><p >In honor of Veterans' Day (also known as Armistice Day), I'm posting here a short essay on the poem that inspired the Flanders poppy, John McCrae's "In Flanders Fields." This "essay" is actually a section of my 2004 dissertation, which concerns the 19-line poetic form called "the villanelle"; in the course of researching that, I noodled around with some rondeaus as well (or "rondeaux," if you want to get all French about it), and, to put it plainly, I just got really really interested in the most famous rondeau of all, "In Flanders Fields." &#13;

A much more significant individual poem in the social history of the French forms than Pound's "Villanelle" was John McCrae's rondeau "In Flanders Fields," first published anonymously in the December 8, 1915 issue of London's widely-circulated illustrated magazine <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Punch</em>:&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >&#13;
In Flanders fields the poppies blow&#13;
Between the crosses, row on row,&#13;

Scarce heard amid the guns below.&#13;

"In Flanders Fields" was a tremendous popular phenomenon in World War One. Its author, John McCrae, was a Canadian doctor, Scottish by birth, who had served in the Boer War of 1899-1902; he died in 1918, just before the war ended, of pneumonia. Although it is not clear who first singled out the poem in <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Punch</em> for attention, by 1917 it was so well-known that one famous Canadian Victory Bonds poster and billboard could simply allude to it (see Figure 2).	 &#13;

The Victory Bonds campaign had been meant to raise $150 million; instead it raised $400 million, and the poster's artist, Frank Lucien Nicolet, was awarded a prize by the Canadian government.  At least a dozen songs based on the poem appeared between 1917 and 1919, including one by John Philip Sousa.  "Reply poems" also proliferated. Most famously, the Flanders poppy became an instantly recognizable symbol worn in Canada and Britain on November 11, Remembrance Day, to commemorate the Great War dead.  &#13;
&#13;
Few of the patriots and propagandists who quoted the poem seemed aware that it was an example of a traditional French form, a form with a name, history, and fixed scheme. Such knowledge was irrelevant, or seemed so. Reply poems, for instance, invariably imitated "In Flanders Fields" even to the point of lifting entire phrases from it, yet just as invariably altered the scheme even when apparently attempting to emulate it. Medieval and Renaissance fixed-form rondeaus were of ten, thirteen, or fifteen lines; in the nineteenth century, the post-Romantics (including Banville in his <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Petit traitÃÂ© de poÃÂ©sie franÃÂ§aise</em>) overwhelmingly preferred the fifteen-line scheme: aabba aabR aabbaR, with the refrain ("R") consisting of the first few words of the first line of the poem. McCrae's poem, like the rondeaus of post-Romantics such as Banville and Dobson, adheres precisely to this scheme, whereas the scheme of Moina Michael's 1918 reply poem "We Shall Keep the Faith" is only somewhat similar: &#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >&#13;
Oh! you who sleep in Flanders Fields,&#13;
Sleep sweet -- to rise anew!&#13;
We caught the torch you threw&#13;
And holding high, we keep the Faith&#13;
With All who died.&#13;
&#13;
We cherish, too, the poppy red&#13;
That grows on fields where valor led;&#13;
It seems to signal to the skies&#13;
That blood of heroes never dies,&#13;
But lends a lustre to the red&#13;
Of the flower that blooms above the dead&#13;
In Flanders Fields.&#13;
&#13;
And now the Torch and Poppy Red&#13;
We wear in honor of our dead.&#13;
Fear not that ye have died for naught;&#13;
We'll teach the lesson that ye wrought&#13;
In Flanders Fields. (Michael 3)&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
The scheme of Michael's poem is abbcd eeffggR gghhR; it is a form based essentially on stanzas of rhymed couplets with a single hemistich appended to each stanza. With its three top-heavy stanzas of varying length, it looks like "In Flanders Fields," but it is almost as different in structure as it is in tone, diction, meter, and sense.  Moina Michael, a teacher at the University of Georgia, had seen McCrae's "In Flanders Fields" reprinted in the <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Ladies' Home Journal</em> just before the Armistice in 1918, and the poem and accompanying illustration (see Figure 3) moved her so strongly that, she reported, she immediately composed the above poem on the back of an envelope. &#13;
&#13;

 &#13;

&#13;
Subsequently, Michael was the prime mover in getting the Flanders poppy adopted as a Remembrance Day symbol, and was the first to sell artificial poppies as a fundraising tactic. Despite her great investment in the poem's message and symbolism, however, she remained unaware of the tradition behind its form. &#13;
&#13;
Perhaps the most notable example of ignorance of the rondeau with respect to "In Flanders Fields" came in 1919, when a posthumous collection of McCrae's poems was published. A biographical essay appended to <!-- copied at 1 --><em >In Flanders Fields, and Other Poems</em> explained at length that "In Flanders Fields" was a highly original variety of sonnet. Sir Andrew Macphail, who had edited the University Magazine at McGill University in Montreal when McCrae was a student there, claimed that he had known that McCrae was the author of the anonymous poem in <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Punch</em> because he recognized its form, having remembered publishing an earlier poem of McCrae's titled "The Night Cometh" with the same scheme:&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >It will be observed at once by reference to the text that in form the two poems are identical. They contain the same number of lines and feet as surely all sonnets do. Each travels upon two rhymes with the members of a broken couplet in widely separated refrain.[Ã¢ÂÂ¦] It was a form upon which he had worked for years, and made his own. When the moment arrived the medium was ready. No other medium could have so well conveyed the thought (50).</blockquote>&#13;
 &#13;
Macphail, unaware that both poems are rondeaus, argues that their (supposedly) unusual form is proof of McCrae's originality. Macphail, led in his opinion by another semi-literary army officer, even avers that "In Flanders Fields" has reached such a height of innovative structural excellence that its novel "sonnet" form might well become fixed: &#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >&#13;
The poem was first called to my attention by a Sapper officer, then Major, now Brigadier. [Ã¢ÂÂ¦] This officer could himself weave the sonnet with deft fingers, and he pointed out many deep things. It is to the sappers that the army always goes for "technical material." &#13;
&#13;
	The poem, he explained, consists of thirteen lines in iambic tetrameter and two lines of two iambics each; in all, one line more than the sonnet's count. There are two rhymes only, since the short lines must be considered blank, and are, in fact, identical. But it is a difficult mode. It is true, he allowed, that the octet of the sonnet has only two rhymes, but these recur only four times, and the liberty of the sestet tempers its despotism,--which I thought a pretty phrase.[Ã¢ÂÂ¦] One is so often reminded of the poverty of men's invention, their best being so incomplete, that one welcomes what--this Sapper officer surmised--may become a new and fixed mode of expression in verse. (53-5)</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
This ingeniously incorrect explication shows that the fact that "In Flanders Fields" was a rondeau had nothing to do with its popular success. It was not held up as an excellent example of the form, as it is today in some poetry handbooks. The form was unknown to most of McCrae's contemporary readers, even to those with literary pretensions and with a strong desire to prove that McCrae was a gifted poet. There can be little doubt that if the sapper officer had known of the rondeau, Macphail would have argued that skill with a traditional form rather than formal innovation was McCrae's particular gift. Clearly the influence of modernism's "make it new" philosophy had sufficiently permeated the mainstream for Macphail to be able to cite inventiveness as a positive trait for a poet--yet Macphail seems slightly embarrassed to be taking such a position: "one welcomes" innovation only because there is little else to welcome. &#13;
&#13;
The explanation for John McCrae's adoption of the rondeau form is likely to have been almost exactly the opposite of that forwarded by Macphail. McCrae's rondeau, like Stephen's villanelle, shows that its author is writing from the cautious margins rather making daring Poundian forays from the safe center. To be Canadian was to be at least as provincial (by London and Oxford standards) as to be Irish; McCrae, ten years older than Joyce and by profession a doctor, never made the move that Joyce made away from late-Victorian styles toward a fresh and international, or extra-national, modernist experimentalism. McCrae had begun publishing poetry in McGill's <!-- copied at 1 --><em >University Magazine</em>, <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Varsity</em>, and <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Canadian Magazine</em> in the eighteen-nineties. In form many of McCrae's poems, like Joyce's in <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Chamber Music</em>, were simple abab or aabb stanzas; there were also several ballads, indicating that McCrae had been influenced by the pre-Raphaelites and/or by Scottish models. Two poems, "Isandlwana" and "The Song of the Derelict," are on a scheme which appears to be a rather unusual ballad variation: aRaRbbbR. Robert Burns's "Duncan Gray," composed about 1792, is on the same scheme; the Scotland-born McCrae might here be placing himself in a Scottish tradition. That the rondeau was a "French" form may have contributed to his interest in it (though his models were more likely to be the English examples of the eighteen-eighties and eighteen-nineties); McCrae's poetry, with its French and Scottish and English schemes, almost seems to imitate the elbow-to-elbow populations of French, Scottish, and English extraction in Montreal. &#13;
&#13;
"In Flanders Fields" has in the twentieth century probably been considered most important in the context of Canadian poetry and Canadian national identity. The scholar Thomas B. Vincent addresses the question of why the heroic ideal survives in the work of McCrae and other Canadian poets of the Great War when British poets such as Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen abandoned that ideal; he attributes this difference chiefly to Canada's emerging nationhood: &#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >Instinctively, if not consciously, the Canadian poets discovered that, culturally, Canada was not Britain. They understood what poets like Owen were talking about; they had the personal experience required to appreciate that. But they knew in their poetic guts that the grim vision of life that energized Owen's verse was not relevant to Canadian imagination in a central way. [Ã¢ÂÂ¦] Among intelligent Canadians, there was no denial of the obscenities of war or of the moral implications of these brutalities, but there was also no denial of the perception that war contributed significantly to national maturation [Ã¢ÂÂ¦] (167) </blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
In this argument, McCrae's poetry defines itself as Canadian by defining itself against British poetry, but it might be more accurate to say that McCrae's poetry defines itself as Canadian by defining itself with pre-war poetry and values. McCrae's values, like his poetic forms, were just behind the curve of nations more secure in their nationhood. &#13;
&#13;
Still, when compared with the typical rondeau in Gleeson White's 1887 anthology <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Ballades and Rondeaus, Chants Royal, Sestinas, Villanelles &amp;c,</em> "In Flanders Fields" looks remarkably modern. "The Sweet, Sad Years," by Rev. Charles D. Bell, D. D., for instance, begins "The sweet sad years; the sun, the rain, / Alas! too quickly did they wane" and continues in the typical key of a pleasurable romantic melancholy expressed in end-stopped lines, archaic diction, and inverted syntax (153). The association of such predictable poems with the rondeau form had never fully entered public consciousness, but serious poetry professionals still remembered, and judged "In Flanders Fields" harshly not only by comparing it to the more radical poems emerging from modernism, but also by comparing it to the puerile rondeaus that had emerged from the vers de sociÃÂ©tÃÂ© movement. When <!-- copied at 1 --><em >In Flanders Fields, and Other Poems</em> was reviewed in the July 1919 issue of <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Poetry</em> along with several other war-themed works, Alice Corbin Henderson (whose unfavorable review of Joyce's <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Chamber Music</em> had appeared in the previous issue of <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Poetry</em>) recognized "In Flanders Fields" as a rondeau. This, she considered, was in itself a flaw:	&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >The books listed above are mostly journalism, but now and then some poem lifts the emotion of the moment into song, thus winning a chance of survival after the moment has passed. John McCrae achieves this in the much-quoted In Flanders Fields--achieves it by sheer simplicity and concentration in the expression of a moving and tragic appeal. Another poem on the same motive  a living soldier's address to The Anxious Dead  is perhaps still finer, and its quatrains fit the subject better than the too slight rondeau form of the first. (221)</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
Henderson was virtually alone among critics in awarding even this qualified praise to "In Flanders Fields"; the poem's very success with an ignorant public probably doomed it in the discriminating eyes of the modernists and their inheritors even after the reputation of the French forms for "slightness" had been forgotten. Yet "In Flanders Fields," rather like Stephen's villanelle, was neither wholly akin to its "too-slight" schematic progenitors nor wholly divided from them, though certainly the poem achieved too perfect a compromise with traditional forms and values to be attractive to the modernists. &#13;
&#13;
"In Flanders Fields" has long been disregarded or harshly judged by literary scholars, most notably by Paul Fussell in his well-known work <!-- copied at 1 --><em >The Great War and Modern Memory</em> (1975), who writes that "words like vicious and stupid would not seem to go too far" to describe the final stanza of the poem. Fussell also avers that "indeed it could be said that the rigorously regular meter with which the poem introduces the poppies makes them seem already fabricated of wire and paper," even though the poem's meter is by no means clumsy, varying through caesura and enjambment if not through substitution (249). Fussell nevertheless makes an interesting point about the implications of the poppy as a choice of symbol; in Fussell's argument, the image of the poppy--like the rondeau form, which Fussell does not discuss--serves to link McCrae's poem with the work of the Decadents:	&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >It would be a mistake to imagine that the poppies in Great War writings got there just because they are actually there in the French and Belgian fields.[Ã¢ÂÂ¦] For half a century before the fortuitous publicity attained by the poppies of Flanders, this association with homoerotic love had been conventional, in works by Wilde, Douglas, the Victorian painter Simeon Solomon, John Addington Symonds, and countless others. (247-8)</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
Fussell sees "the conception of soldiers as lovers" in the lines "Short days ago / We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, / Loved and were loved, and now we lie / In Flanders fields"; such references serve to link the poem only too firmly, in Fussell's view, to "Victorian male sentimental poetry" (248). &#13;
&#13;
Fred Crawford, in his 1988 book <!-- copied at 1 --><em >British Poets of the Great War</em>, shares Fussell's judgment: "That the poem's closing seems unworthy of its beginning results from two abrupt shifts--the change in tone to the demand and threat of the last six lines and the use of chivalric imagery and diction [Ã¢ÂÂ¦] outside the pastoral tradition for which the reader has been prepared" (38). Both critics seem to resent what is after all nothing but a standard volta in the third stanza, finding the turn both unconvincing and offensive, and the more so because the first two stanzas of the poem seem to promise a fully modernist take on the Great War. As Vincent writes, "Indeed, the narrative voice of the poem has some disturbing similarities to that of Eliot's 'Hollow Men' " (169). Vincent, like Crawford and Fussell, places the poem in the pastoral tradition, but because none of these critics discuss the rondeau form, they all miss the point that the poem is most influenced by the faux-pastoral and decidedly chivalric "tradition" of late-Victorian Paris and London. The false pastoral of the "French forms" becomes, even if unintentionally, highly appropriate for the false pastoral of the battlefield, and one of the chief points of "In Flanders Fields" is that pastoral conventions simply cannot be applied any longer. &#13;
&#13;
One of the most interesting aspects of the poem, I would also argue, is the very "demand and threat" that Crawford recoils from. Surely one of the best reasons for its effectiveness as propaganda is its barely buried exposÃÂ© of the true engine of war: the poem appeals only apparently to loyalty; ultimately, it appeals to fear. And fear is why we fight. The central image is of a spectral vengeance that seems more frightening than any merely human war, and the foe seems less menacing than the potentially traitorous civilians on "our" side. The poem's readers were no doubt glad to purchase absolution from an unconfessable fear and guilt by buying indulgences in the form of Victory Bonds and British Legion poppies. &#13;

&#13;
However, I've chosen to write about <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley">Mary Shelley</a>: Mary Shelley, who, in 1816, when she was 19 years old, wrote <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YuUyAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover"><!-- copied at 1 --><em>Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus</em></a> (1818). If you concede that <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Frankenstein</em> is the first science fiction novel (and many do), then it's certainly worth honoring Mary Shelley on Ada Lovelace day. And, of course, Mary was married to Percy Bysshe Shelley, who's in the Most Famous Romantic Poets club with Byron, and Byron was there at the famed Swiss gathering where Mary began <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Frankenstein</em>  -- and Byron was Ada Lovelace's father. &#13;
&#13;
I can't write anything about Mary Shelley beyond what's on the Wikipedia page, and I haven't read the novel in years (as I recall it was rather turgid, sad to say), but this occasion has led to some pleasant idling around on the Internet, and I figure I can show you what I found. &#13;
&#13;
For instance, did you know that Thomas Edison's motion picture company <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.filmbuffonline.com/Features/EdisonsFrankenstein1.htm">made a Frankenstein movie in 1910</a>?

I mean, that is some great stuff. Terrific special effects in the creation scene; kinda looks like they burned something and then rolled the film backward. The monster is very creepy looking, and how about that explicit moral with the mirror trick? &#13;
&#13;
I also located an image of a <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/frank2.html">page from Mary Shelley's original manuscript</a>:&#13;
&#13;
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="anthologize-image-wrapper"><img src="FrankensteinDraft.jpg"/></div>&#13;
&#13;
Really clear handwriting. You wouldn't believe how terrible lots of nineteenth-century handwriting is. I did some research on <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Somerville">Mary Somerville</a> back in grad school (another great heroine of science), and I had to really work to read her writing. I agree, Mary: "beautiful" is much more effective than "handsome," there, and "yellow skin" is much better than "dun skin." &#13;
&#13;
I also browsed through one of the original reviews of <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Frankenstein</em>, which appeared in the <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Quarterly Review</em>, and which called the book "<!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fVoAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA379&amp;dq=%22modern+prometheus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=1817&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=1818&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=PK_JSdWKKJzazQS31oyPAw#PPA382,M1">a tissue of horrible and disgusting absurdity</a>." They just did not mince words back then. Interesting choice, that word "tissue" -- wonder if the reviewer (who remained anonymous) meant to evoke the medical sense of the term. No one knew that the author was a woman, by the way, so you can't attribute that blunt opinion to sexism. &#13;
&#13;
Finally, I did a search for the word "science" in the book itself, which produced some interesting results. At one point, Frankenstein's college professor advises him as follows: &#13;
&#13;
</p><!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >"If your wish is to become really a man of science, and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics" (<!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YuUyAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA66,M1">66</a>).</blockquote> &#13;
&#13;
This made me think of Steven Johnson's <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/223801504&amp;referer=brief_results">The Invention of Air</a>, which I've just finished; Johnson argues that Joseph Priestley was a bit of a petty experimentalist but that he, and everyone, nevertheless benefited greatly from the innate interdisciplinarity of the era. Shelley got her inspiration for <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Frankenstein</em>, by the way, from some experiments with electrocuting worms that <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Darwin">Erasmus Darwin</a> did, and Erasmus Darwin was an intellectual contemporary and crony of Priestley's. There's also this: &#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science.

&#13;
Yeah, I don't really believe that. I think in all studies there's "continual food for discovery and wonder." However, I am mollified by the rather interesting discovery that when we stop getting the story in Dr. Frankenstein's voice and start getting it in the monster's voice (did you know that? that the monster narrates part of the story in eloquent Enlightenment prose? It was a shock to me when I first read the book, I'll tell you.) -- in any case, as I was saying, when the monster begins to write, he starts referring to language as a "science": &#13;

Someone go write an NEH, NSF, IMLS, NHPRC, or Mellon grant with <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com/jobrieniii">the developer</a>. I'm busy blogging. &#13;
&#13;
I also counted (well, got Excel to count) the number of unique Twitterers. For me, the most interesting statistics are definitely these: <!-- copied at 1 --><strong>only 3% (at most) of MLA attendees were twittering</strong>, while <!-- copied at 1 --><strong>almost twice as many people twittered about THATcamp as actually attended it</strong>. (THATcamp, as if you didn't know, is The Humanities And Technology <strike>conference</strike> camp.) &#13;
&#13;
This year, I was a little disappointed not to go to MLA, especially since it was right down the road from me in Philadelphia. I'd have liked to go, but, like <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.briancroxall.net/2009/12/28/the-absent-presence-todays-faculty/">Brian Croxall</a>, I couldn't afford it -- and I didn't even have a paper to deliver. Last year I went to San Francisco and had a grand old time. I gave a <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://amandafrench.net/From_Horse_and_Buggy.pdf">paper on Google Book Search</a>, I met some <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amandafrench/4229109439/">Internet celebrities</a>, I met some academic celebrities, I met my longtime Internet friend <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://michaelberube.com">Michael BÃÂ©rubÃÂ©</a> in real life for the first time (MLA prez! 2012! kewl!), I hobnobbed with the old UVa gang, I went to a panel about Twitter, I went to a panel about digitizing manuscripts, I heard a paper by John Lyon about the Penguin Archive, I heard a paper by Mark Edmundson about the dangers of the digital, I bought and read a <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61296009">copy of <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Candide</em> with cartoons on the cover</a>, and I blogged about the conference afterward. I had a great time, and I felt like a learned a lot. &#13;
&#13;
I was therefore looking forward to following along with MLA via Twitter, but I was again disappointed. Somehow I had thought that at least some of those analog humanists at MLA would be twittering by now. The Executive Director of MLA <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com/mlaconvention">was twittering</a>; why shouldn't they? I thought I'd get to read at least a few lyrically concise reports of panels in my non-digital field of poetic form, panels such as "Sonnets in Stories" and "Literary Form and the Social: Victorian Poetry" and "The Thinking Proper to Poetry." But no: there seemed to be almost no one twittering except the digital humanists whom I already know very well -- poor Kathleen Fitzpatrick practically turned herself into a secretary for me, and Mark Sample was apparently <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com/samplereality/status/7133052347">glared at and hissed at and mentally calumnied</a> for attempting to keep the rest of us apprised. I'm spoiled, now, because the people I follow on Twitter tend to be terrific at reporting on the conferences they attend; I followed the Society of American Archivists' conference back in August, for instance. And then, too, even at the conferences I've attended this year, it's been terrific to be able to see what went on in the sessions I wasn't able to attend in person.&#13;
&#13;
The point is that the reportage coming out of MLA was very digital-humanities-centric, not least because of Twitter. No one is more aware of that than we digital humanists. Everyone (by which I mean everyone on Twitter) has been expressing doubt about William Pannapacker's assertion that the big story of MLA 2009 was the digital humanities. Pannapacker <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/The-MLAthe-Digital/19468/">wrote in the <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Chronicle</em></a> that "the merger of literature and technology is no longer the obsession of a few hobbyists" -- for one thing, it hasn't been quite <!-- copied at 1 --><em>that</em> marginalized for quite awhile. (Hi to all my Twitter buddies at our own special Office of the Digital Humanities at the NEH!) What does seem more accurate is Pannapacker's observation that "the digital humanities seem like the first 'next big thing' in a long time" -- except, again, I feel as though I've known that for at least five years, and I could make a good case for ten. &#13;
&#13;
For instance, one of the MLA papers that got the most Twitter ink was a great <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.briancroxall.net/2009/12/28/the-absent-presence-todays-faculty/">piece by Brian Croxall</a>. I know Brian quite well, mostly through Twitter, though I first met him down at Emory in 2007, then again at last year's MLA, then again at THATcamp this summer. I've followed Brian's hunt for a job and the birth of his third child on Twitter, and today I was very pleased indeed to see that his paper earned him quite a bit of attention. All that Twitter ink put it in the automatically generated digital humanities journal <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/2009/12/29/missing-in-action-at-the-mla-todays-teachers-of-todays-students-teaching-the-chronicle-of-higher-education/"><!-- copied at 1 --><em>DH Now</em></a>, and then it was <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Missing-in-Action-at/63276/">deftly written up</a> by Jennifer Howard in the <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em>, and then it was blogged with tremendous vitality by <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://bitchphd.blogspot.com/2009/12/auld-lang-syne.html">Bitch Ph.D.</a>, whom the profession plundered and squandered. &#13;
&#13;
Let me put it this way: Brian's paper was big news only on Twitter and in the blogosphere. Which, however, means that it was big news. Period.&#13;
&#13;
Twitter is writing. Hello! MLA members! Twitter is writing! Twittering often feels like chatting -- and indeed Twitter is in some ways simply a global public instant-message service with the clever addition of asymmetrical channels of communication -- but Twitter is writing. And that makes it distinctively different. The Twitter comments about Brian's paper didn't really amount to much more than you'd get in a hallway after a particularly honest paper about the asbestos-like conditions of being a "Visiting" Assistant Professor at Clemson. (I've been a "Visiting" Assistant Professor, too, by the way, in a place where I was, you know, living, not visiting, and where I would have liked to stay.) But those comments were in writing. And, you know, so long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, so long lives this, and all that. &#13;
&#13;
Now, Brian's paper was very good indeed, but what was especially brilliant was that he posted it <!-- copied at 1 --><strong>at the same time</strong> that he would otherwise have been reading the paper aloud to a room full of interested and sympathetic listeners, listeners largely without smartphones, sitting similarly without laptops in a room without wi-fi where to send an SMS message would be nearly grounds for ejection. The lesson digital humanists learn, especially by using Twitter, is that scholarly conversations move quickly now, because they can, and one had therefore better be as quick as possible to join in that conversation. Monthly or quarterly journals and annual conferences used to be the way that scholars <strike>talked</strike> wrote among themselves, but now it's e-mail listservs (yes, still) and, better, the much more public blogosphere and twittersphere. &#13;
&#13;
Let us refresh ourselves, for a moment, with this very fuzzy and very infringing YouTube video: &#13;
&#13;
<object width="560" height="340"><!-- copied at 1 --><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/EbVKWCpNFhY&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;"/><!-- copied at 1 --><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><!-- copied at 1 --><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/EbVKWCpNFhY&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"/></object>&#13;
&#13;
Usually what one quotes from this gem of pop culture is the immortal phrase "These go to 11" or "This one goes to 11." However, what I want to suggest is that the emerging forms of scholarly communication among digital humanists go to 10 -- but 10 is louder. Here's the metaphor, or allegory, as I see it.&#13;
&#13;
</p><!-- copied at 1 --><ul ><!-- copied at 1 --><li>Amplifier that goes to 10 = Old scholarly communication, such as insanely slow-to-publish journals.</li>&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><li>Unseen but perfectly possible amplifier that goes to louder 10 = New scholarly communication, such as Twitter, blogs, unconferences, and models such as the journal <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://dhnow.org">DH Now</a> and the book <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/mcpress/plannedobsolescence/">Planned Obsolescence</a>.  </li>&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><li>Amplifier that goes to 11 = Second Life and ilk. Not, ultimately, an improvement.</li>&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><li>Watts, phantom power, gain, reverb = Functions of scholarly communication, such as learning, arguing, establishing a reputation, filtering information. </li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
Here's looking forward to #MLA11. It'll be interesting to see what happens then.&#13;
</div></div><div class="library-item"><h3 class="library-item-title">On persuasion, perfectibility, and the abolishment of academic copyright</h3><div class="library-item-content"><!-- copied at 1 --><p >Despite what <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com/dancohen/status/2763011660">Dan Cohen</a> averred yesterday, Steven Shavell is apparently <!-- copied at 1 --><em>not</em> arguing that we should abolish copyright for academic works. His title is a question -- "<!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.law.harvard.edu/files/Copyright%207-17HLS-2009.pdf">Should Copyright of Academic Works Be Abolished?</a>" -- and it is a question that he claims to explore, not answer: &#13;
&#13;
</p><!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >On the basis of a number of empirical judgments Ã¢ÂÂ notably, that universities and grantors would tend to subsidize publication fees Ã¢ÂÂ I suggested that ending academic copyright would be socially beneficial. The reader may, of course, make different empirical assessments and come to a different conclusion. My principal goal was not to persuade the reader that my empirical judgments are correct but rather to identify and clarify the factors bearing on the social desirability of ending copyright of academic works. (54-5)</blockquote> &#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><p >It's a good thing he's not trying to persuade, because he hasn't. I could wish that he had met his principal goal, but I'm afraid he hasn't met that, either. There's not much that's clear about this article.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><p >What is it that bothers me so much about this piece? It can't only be the style: it's not fair to judge someone for writing in an approved idiom, no matter how idiotic that idiom may seem to others. I am not, after all, a lawyer. It can't only be the suggestion that ending academic copyright would be socially beneficial, because I'm predisposed to be friendly to that view. I think perhaps that what most bothers me is the discontinuity between the style and the argument. The proposition that copyright should be abolished for academic works is a dramatic one, and yet Shavell writes as though the question is, well, merely academic. Just a suggestion, not an actual persuasive argument that might have human consequences. For instance, Shavell's list of the "social benefits from eliminating academic copyright Ã¢ÂÂ deriving from the free availability of academic works" is limited to some very dull things: &#13;
&#13;
</p><!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >Faculty and students do not have ready access to all articles on the Internet and often face costly-in-time hurdles to locate what is in theory freely available. The assembly of teaching materials from articles and the printing of them is often seriously constrained by copyright. Further, many academics and students in institutions without substantial resources (including many small colleges and junior colleges in the United States and teaching institutions in other countries) cannot afford to pay for more than a narrow segment of journals. Additionally, there are numerous individuals who are not members of the university community but who wish to read academic works. When one takes these observations into account and aggregates the benefits of a copyright-free world over the relevant populations and the huge number of articles that are published, my supposition is that the sum would be substantial. (36)</blockquote> &#13;
&#13;
These are "social" benefits? These, only these, are the "social" benefits to be brought about by an unprecedented and extremely unlikely transformation of U.S. law? They hardly seem worth it. They seem largely limited to universities, moreover. Let's see some rhetorical life, here, some blood and spit! The ill, cured by free medical research! The inconsolable, cured by free philosophy! Climate change skeptics startled by a sudden rain of environmental studies! Cultural criticism at last ungated to the culture it critiques! Rivers in India cleansed of bacteria! Wells in Africa dug! Global dissemination of enlightenment! &#13;
&#13;
I see that irony has suffused those last sentences, which just shows the bad karma of mocking another's writing style. Suffice it to say that one can believe that academic research should be given to the public while also believing that both academics and the public are human and thus resistant to perfectibility.&#13;
&#13;
Well, if it's difficult to make a significant contribution to human perfectibility through the production or consumption of academic research, it's fairly easy to summarize, and everyone's always grateful for that. Shavell's argument runs thus (the following is redacted but verbatim, save for material in brackets, which I have added): &#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >&#13;
[1] Academic authors would still have a strong affirmative motivation to publish in the absence of copyright Ã¢ÂÂ to gain scholarly esteem and to advance themselves professionally.&#13;
&#13;
[2] Publication fees, however, would probably be charged by publishers in the absence of academic copyright, and the fees would be more than nominal.&#13;
&#13;
[3] If academics would have to bear publication fees in the absence of copyright, their incentive to write and to publish would fall.&#13;
&#13;
[4] If, however, academics would not have to bear publication fees Ã¢ÂÂ because universities or grantors would pay them Ã¢ÂÂ their incentive to write and to publish articles would tend to rise, and so might their incentive to write and publish books.&#13;
&#13;
[5] Universities and grantors would have a motive to subsidize publication fees in a world without copyright. [This motive, according to Shavell, is that library costs would fall dramatically, since libraries would have to pay a dramatically lesser amount for books and journals.]&#13;
&#13;
[6] The effect of elimination of academic copyright on the level of publication depends on the extent to which universities and grantors would subsidize publication fees. Because of the motive of universities and grantors to subsidize these fees, it is plausible that the number of published works Ã¢ÂÂ especially articles Ã¢ÂÂ would increase, and in any event, would not decline substantially.&#13;
&#13;
[7] To the degree that publications would be discouraged by the elimination of academic copyright, the social losses would be limited because the publications would not ordinarily be of high quality.&#13;
&#13;
[8] The social loss from a discouraged publication would also be limited because an unpublished work could be posted on the Internet.&#13;
&#13;
[9] To the degree that publications would be encouraged by the elimination of academic copyright and subsidy of publication fees, either social gains or losses could be engendered. The latter problem might be offset by university and grantor efforts to condition subsidy on quality. &#13;
&#13;
[10] Summary Ã¢ÂÂ the effect of elimination of copyright on authorsÃ¢ÂÂ incentives to publish might not be negative overall Ã¢ÂÂ it might lead to more publications, due to subsidy of publication fees Ã¢ÂÂ and to the extent that it would discourage publications, the loss in social welfare would probably be limited.&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
Without going through all ten points above (though I'm tempted), I'd say that the chief problem with this argument is how puppetlike the motivations of the interested parties seem. Academics, publishers, universities, all have rational motivations in the above argument, which they certainly do not in the academic world I live in (bless our imperfect little hearts). Take point 5, especially, that universities would have a motive to subsidize publication fees for faculty members if the library subscription costs were to plummet dramatically. That, my friends, is logical, which means that it's entirely unrealistic. If library costs were to plummet dramatically, "the university" is just as likely to take the money and spend it on a football stadium or scholarships for need-based students or the salaries of upper-level administrators or health insurance for its protesting and about-to-strike graduate student lab assistants and teaching assistants. A university is a complex place, with the left hand frequently strangling the right hand. It's already the case that "the university" simultaneously a) requires junior faculty to publish before it promotes them, and b) strips funds from its university press if it has one, thus making it harder for anyone and everyone to publish. There's a great deal in Shavell's argument that depends not on law, but on organizational policy. &#13;
&#13;
Another of my general objections to Shavell's piece is his unquestioning and undefined use of terms such as "an academic." As someone who would like to reserve the right to write academic works without necessarily being an academic, this bothers me. Think of "journalist": we never quite realized until recently that we defined a journalist as "someone who is employed by a media company"; those were the only people who <!-- copied at 1 --><em >could</em> be journalists, and therefore we never thought much, as a culture, about it. Now, of course, when almost anyone can start up a blog and do a form of journalism, we're starting to realize that we might need some kind of content-based, purpose-based definition of journalism, so that we know who can have journalistic privileges such as the right to keep a source private. &#13;
&#13;
Similarly, it seems to me very unwise to tie a law of this magnitude to the assumption that "an academic" is a definable entity, not to mention "a publisher" or "a university." Is a grad student an academic? Is a library with an institutional repository a publisher? Is <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.techuofa.com">Tech U of America</a> a university? Is the law going to be asked to determine these things? According to Shavell, an "academic work" could be known by "whether its authors are usually academics; whether its readers are mainly academics; the degree to which its content is academic in character (displays sophistication and knowledge of prior learning); and, most important, the magnitude of any royalties received by authors (low or no royalties would favor classification as academic)" (48-49). Great. Another four-factor test. To be administered by an "expert extra-judicial body" (49). And, as you'll note, dependent on definitions of "academics," which to my knowledge are not already legally determined. I might be more receptive to the argument that works produced by non-profit entities should be without copyright; that's an existing legal structure. Finally, how would the amount of royalties (or, in the case of journals, other money not paid) be a factor in determining whether a work was academic given that if the law were passed, no one would receive any royalties? &#13;
&#13;
Kathleen Fitzpatrick has outlined what I think is a much more realistic proposal for scholarly publishing, one that takes into account real human and institutional motivations and behaviors. In her <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.mith2.umd.edu/dh09/wp-content/uploads/dh09_conferencepreceedings_final.pdf">paper at the Digital Humanities 2009 conference</a>, she argued for a "hybrid" economic model for the university press, a model that is "neither a wholly commercial nor a wholly gift-based economy, but rather one that creates value for users by offering  services they desire, thereby encouraging them to contribute their labor to the enterprise" (106). She outlined a persuasive model in which "presses return to their earlier, service relationship to authors within their own institutions, in order to more firmly cement their position within the heart of the universityÃ¢ÂÂs overall mission" (106). In other words, since universities do indeed want their faculty to publish, universities might be persuaded to turn university presses back into what they used to be: a means of disseminating their own faculty's work. This, granted, is also an ambitious proposition, though it's not on the level of abolishing copyright for academic work. But Kathleen is aware of that: she writes that her argument is a "radical shift" for presses. She clearly knows that part of her job in writing such a paper is indeed to persuade. Thank heavens for that. (Not to mention her clarity.) &#13;
&#13;
What, then, divorced from Shavell's treatment of it, of the idea that copyright ought to be abolished for academic work? Let's also set aside its feasibility, which is minimal at best. On the whole, I don't particularly like it. I want to retain my copyrights, if only to give them away with my own hand. I CC-license my work for non-commercial purposes only (although that too is an elastic term); however unlikely it may be, I don't want someone taking my work and selling it directly, which can easily happen when there's no copyright at all on a work. Shavell, by the way, seems always to assume that uncopyrighted work means free work, which is simply not true. My favorite example is the 9/11 report, which, as a government document, was and is in the public domain, yet it was <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://bit.ly/BPeSY">a bestseller for the publisher Norton</a>, who made tons of money on it by printing it up and distributing it through bookstores. &#13;
&#13;
And, although I might be risking something or another by saying so, I'll also admit that I think it might not be a bad idea for tenure-track faculty members to give their copyrights to universities. (With their own hands.) As I understand it, academics' writings would be considered "work-for-hire" under the law, except that most universities and colleges explicitly disclaim their right to it as a matter of policy. In this changing publishing environment, I think it'd be a good idea to rethink that. It might help Kathleen's model gain traction, for one thing. Junior scholars, as we all know, often loathe themselves for how eager they (we) are to publish their (our) way into a modicum of career advancement; I'd bet that there are plenty who would be more than willing to give copyright to the university, instead of to a press or journal. This would work best on the "publish, then filter" model of peer review, in which scholars' work is published and <!-- copied at 1 --><em >then</em> reviewed. Just imagine how freeing it would be to stop worrying about whether your work will be published. It would give you so much more time to worry about whether your work is any good. &#13;
&#13;

<!-- copied at 1 --><p >All My Internet Friends&#13;
&#13;
Monday afternoon I gave a presentation to the staff&#13;
Kicked off with a knock-knock joke to liven up the charts and graphs&#13;
That crowd&#13;
Never laughs out loud&#13;
&#13;
But all my internet friends were tickled pink&#13;
They put animated smileys when they passed around the link&#13;
They said, Hey, girl, here's another awesome thing we found&#13;
Sarah Palin getting smacked down&#13;
With a Prince song in the background&#13;
Better watch it quick before they take it down&#13;
&#13;
Wednesday night I figured I'd go out and buy a DVD&#13;
Walked into a store and walked right out again immediately&#13;
This sucks&#13;
They want thirty bucks&#13;
&#13;
But all my internet friends give things away&#13;
They just really like to make stuff even when it doesn't pay&#13;
They say, Hey, girl, here's a picture, here's a poem too&#13;
Here's a blog post, here's a podcast&#13;
Here's a song and here's a lolcat&#13;
And an iPhone application all for you&#13;
&#13;
Saturday I had a date with Dave the software engineer&#13;
Told him 'bout the time I got my headphones wrapped around my ear&#13;
I swear&#13;
He just didn't care&#13;
&#13;
But all my internet friends, they listen well&#13;
They make sympathetic comments when I say that I'm in hell&#13;
They say, Hey, girl, what's your status&#13;
I say, Omigod,&#13;
I'm not sleeping, I'm not eating&#13;
I can't take another meeting&#13;
With the clean, well-meaning morons at my job&#13;
&#13;
There are those who say I spend a little too much time online&#13;
Sometimes I agree, but on the whole I think I'm doing fine&#13;
Click, buzz&#13;
I feel strong because&#13;
&#13;
All my internet friends are here with me&#13;
Saying, Love and information want only to be free&#13;
And we'll take no crap from anyone who says that they know better&#13;
We won't stand for that because we all came here together&#13;
We're remaining interwoven&#13;
We're a net, and we have chosen&#13;
To be knotted tightly to each other&#13;
You be client, I'll be server&#13;
We won't ever have to be alone&#13;
</p>&#13;

One panelist talked about following all of the Twitter feeds using the word Ã¢ÂÂMichelleÃ¢ÂÂ during Michelle ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs convention speech, and what that was like, reading it all, left and right and everywhere, as it was happening, a shower of opinion, and a far more sophisticated slice of audience response than the CNN sliding audience monitor on the bottom of the screen.

<!-- copied at 1 --><p >As I mentioned in an update to my previous post, IÃ¢ÂÂd like to spend some time thinking about microblogging in general and Twitter in particular. As the election season deepened, I became a much more avid Twitter user, and the Twitter panel at MLA, reviewed here by media scholar Cathy Davidson, covered many of the strengths (and concerns) about Twitter. As the panelists pointed out, a number of critics have argued that Twitter fosters an unhealthy narcissism and that it prevents deeper reflection. However, these readings often focus only at the level of the individual Ã¢ÂÂtweet,Ã¢ÂÂ which taken out of context can seem a bit navel-gazing. Instead, the panel helped to provide a language for thinking about the connective elements of Twitter and its larger role in aggregating knowledge. To be sure, this aggregation could (and probably will) be used in some form of data miningÃ¢ÂÂimagine what the two major political parties could do with all of this yearÃ¢ÂÂs election tweetsÃ¢ÂÂbut the Ã¢ÂÂambient intimacyÃ¢ÂÂ of Twitter can be used in a variety of powerful ways, as Shaun Huston and Nick Rombes point out in a couple of recent posts.

&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><p >Next, [I] examined Twitter through the work of compositionist Fred Kemp, arguing that microblogging creates new kinds of aggregated texts that must be understood as collective entities rather than in their individual pieces. Thus, any one "tweet" may not make sense outside of the larger discourse, that is, the larger collective environment, in which that tweet was made. The various ways in which individual tweets can be aggregated, however, destabilize those collective environments since information can be arranged and rearranged in many different ways.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><p >[I] argued that this leads at least two conclusions. First, debates over the value of internet communication services like blogs, Facebook, or Twitter can be usefully viewed as debates over how to value the texts these services generate and what constitutes the boundaries of those texts. Kemp states: "The value of written conversations Ã¢ÂÂ¦ lies in the organic and open-ended nature of knowledge making they display, not in their transmitted factual increments, which are usually, and crudely, termed information" (187, orig. emphasis). When critics attack the worth of Twitter, they are, more often then not, focusing on the "transmitted factual increments,"Ã¢ÂÂthat is, singular tweetsÃ¢ÂÂrather than examining the non-traditional texts created by these individual tweets.

It was excellent, a good rundown <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.hastac.org/node/1876">here</a>. Not only were the presentations themselves engaging, but the panel as a whole felt radically more productive than the typical conference panel because the presenters decided to limit themselves to about 5 minutes of speaking so as to allow more time for actual conversation. And then THEY DID. These academics, they spoke for about 5 minutes! It was awesome! I can actually follow something for 5 minutes. The ensuing conversation was so smart and dialogic I felt like everyone was engaged at a level one doesn't often see at these things.

<!-- copied at 1 --><p > IÃ¢ÂÂve certainly had my moments of skepticism toward the larger purposes of literary research while sitting through dull conference sessions, but my MLA experience actually made me feel jazzed and hopeful about the humanities.  ThatÃ¢ÂÂs because the sessions that I attended -- mostly panels on the digital humanities -- explored topics that seemed both intellectually rich and relevant to the contemporary moment. For instance, panelists discussed the significance of networked reading, dealing with information abundance, new methods for conducting research such as macroanalysis and visualization, participatory learning, copyright challenges, the shift (?) to digital publishing, digital preservation, and collaborative editing. . . .</p>&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><p >. . .This was my first MLA and, despite having to leave home smack in the middle of the holidays, I enjoyed it.   Although many sessions that I attended shifted away from the Ã¢ÂÂread your paper aloud when people are perfectly capable of reading it themselvesÃ¢ÂÂ model, I noted the MLAÃ¢ÂÂs requirement that authors bring three copies of their paper to provide upon request, which raises the question what if you donÃ¢ÂÂt have a paper (just Powerpoint slides or notes) and why canÃ¢ÂÂt you share electronically? And why doesnÃ¢ÂÂt the MLA  provide fuller descriptions of the sessions besides just title and speakers?  (Or am I just not looking in the right place?)  Sure, in the paper era that would mean the conference issue of PMLA would be several volumes thick, but if the information were online there would be a much richer record of each session.  (Or you could enlist bloggers or twitterers [tweeters?] to summarize each sessionÃ¢ÂÂ¦) After attending THAT Camp, IÃ¢ÂÂm a fan of the unconference model, which fosters the kind of engagement that conferences should be all aboutÃ¢ÂÂconversation, brainstorming, and problem-solving rather than passive listening.  But lively discussions often do take place during the Q &amp; A period and in the hallways after the sessions (and who knows what takes place elsewhereÃ¢ÂÂ¦) [<!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/2009/01/11/digital-humanities-sessions-at-mla-2008/">link</a>]</p>&#13;

Also, notice that both sets of rankings emphasize teaching as a measure of excellence, which does not match the incentive programs for faculty at most R1 universities. Apparently research doesn't come into it at all. Hmm.&#13;

With today's <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10164909-16.html">outrage</a> over Facebook's newly altered <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php">Terms of Service</a> at its peak, I figured I'd do a quick comparison of their terms of service as regards user-uploaded content to the terms specified by other social networking sites, just to see if said outrage is fully justified. It looks as though the <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://boingboing.net/2009/01/20/obamas-whitehousegov.html">finger-pointing</a> at the Bush robots.txt file <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10146802-38.html">wasn't justified</a>, for instance, and I was guilty of spreading that story. &#13;
&#13;
Conclusion? Go ahead and be outraged. Facebook's claims to your content are extraordinarily grabby and arrogant. Here's the rundown, which I go through in more detail below: &#13;
&#13;
</p><!-- copied at 1 --><ol ><!-- copied at 1 --><li>Facebook apparently wants to keep all its rights to your stuff <!-- copied at 1 --><em>after</em> you remove it from Facebook, and even after you delete your Facebook account; they just removed the lines that specified that their rights end when your content comes down. Nobody else (of those I looked at) would dream of that; mostly they specifically state that their rights to your content end when you remove the content from their site or delete your account.</li>&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><li>This one kills me: Facebook claims it can do whatever it wants with your content <!-- copied at 1 --><em>if you put a Share on Facebook link on your web page</em>. Unbelievable--and unique, as far as I can tell. People can post links in Facebook to your content just by copying and pasting the URL, but if you want to save them a few keystrokes by putting a link or a widget on your site, Facebook claims that you've granted them a whole mess of rights. Count me out.</li>&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><li>Other sites point out in their terms of service that you still own your content: Facebook doesn't mention that little fact. Facebook also neglects to remind you that you're giving other Facebook users rights to your Facebook content, too -- YouTube, for example, makes it clear that other people besides YouTube have a right to use and spread around the videos you upload. In general, other sites' terms of service just have a more helpful tone.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
&#13;
So let's look at what other popular user-generated content sites say about their rights to your stuff:&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><h4 ><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=misc.terms">MySpace's rights to your stuff</a>:</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >&#13;
6.1        MySpace does not claim any ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, applications, or any other materials (collectively, "Content") that you post on or through the MySpace Services.  After posting your Content to the MySpace Services, you continue to retain any such rights that you may have in your Content, subject to the limited license herein.  By displaying or publishing ("posting") any Content on or through the MySpace Services, you hereby grant to MySpace a limited license to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such Content solely on or through the MySpace Services, including without limitation distributing part or all of the MySpace Website in any media formats and through any media channels, except Content marked Ã¢ÂÂprivateÃ¢ÂÂ will not be distributed outside the MySpace Website.  This limited license does not grant MySpace the right to sell or otherwise distribute your Content outside of the MySpace Services.  After you remove your Content from the MySpace Website we will cease distribution as soon as practicable, and at such time when distribution ceases, the license will terminate.  If after we have distributed your Content outside the MySpace Website you change the ContentÃ¢ÂÂs privacy setting to Ã¢ÂÂprivate,Ã¢ÂÂ we will cease distribution of such Ã¢ÂÂprivateÃ¢ÂÂ Content outside the MySpace Website as soon as practicable after you make the change.&#13;
&#13;
6.2        The license you grant to MySpace is non-exclusive (meaning you are free to license your Content to anyone else in addition to MySpace), fully-paid and royalty-free (meaning that MySpace is not required to pay you for the use on the MySpace Services of the Content that you post), sublicensable (so that MySpace is able to use its affiliates, subcontractors and other partners such as Internet content delivery networks and wireless carriers to provide the MySpace Services), and worldwide (because the Internet and the MySpace Services are global in reach). &#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
See? MySpace grants itself a "limited" license and carefully spells out what those limits are. MySpace does a terrific job in that second paragraph especially of explaining what's going on, I think. Maybe your average thirteen-year-old would still need some help, but way to go with the "human-readable" language, MySpace. Getting an explanation about why they need to be able to sublicense the content is terrific, and I'm sure that if they then tried to sublicense it for other purposes, they'd be tripped up by their own TOS. &#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><h4 ><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/">Yahoo!'s rights to your Flickr stuff</a>:</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >&#13;
Yahoo! does not claim ownership of Content you submit or make available for inclusion on the Yahoo! Services. However, with respect to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Yahoo! Services, you grant Yahoo! the following worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive license(s), as applicable [...]:&#13;
&#13;
With respect to photos, graphics, audio or video you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Yahoo! Services other than Yahoo! Groups, the license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the Yahoo! Services solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made available. This license exists only for as long as you elect to continue to include such Content on the Yahoo! Services and will terminate at the time you remove or Yahoo! removes such Content from the Yahoo! Services.&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
Yahoo! makes distinctions between its Groups and other services like Flickr, but that need not concern us here (Yahoo! reserves <!-- copied at 1 --><em >fewer</em> rights to Groups stuff than to Flickr stuff). They start by reminding you that they don't own your stuff, then go on to say that they have the right to copy your stuff "solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted." In other words, they don't grant themselves the right to use it in their advertising, as far as I can tell. And, sanely, the license ends when you (or they) take the content down. I checked out the Flickr Pro TOS, as well, and there's nothing extra in there, whew. I also love that Flickr makes it very easy to stick a Creative Commons license on your photos, although to be honest I'm not sure if I've done that with mine. Must check.&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><h4 ><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://picasa.google.com/intl/en_US/web/tos.html">Google's rights to your Picasa stuff</a>:</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >Google claims no ownership or control over any Content submitted, posted or displayed by you on or through Picasa Web Albums. You or a third party licensor, as appropriate, retain all patent, trademark and copyright to any Content you submit, post or display on or through Picasa Web Albums and you are responsible for protecting those rights, as appropriate.

In addition, by submitting, posting or displaying Content which is intended to be available to the general public, you grant Google a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce, adapt, distribute and publish such Content for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting Google services. Google will discontinue this licensed use within a commercially reasonable period after such Content is removed from Picasa Web Albums.</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
Sounds reasonable. I don't really mind their using my stuff in their advertising, though "other Google services" may soon encompass every single conceivable service on the planet. They, too, stop the license when you take the content down. &#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><h4 ><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/terms">YouTube's rights to your stuff</a>:</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >&#13;
For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your User Submissions. However, by submitting User Submissions to YouTube, you hereby grant YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Submissions in connection with the YouTube Website and YouTube's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the YouTube Website (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each user of the YouTube Website a non-exclusive license to access your User Submissions through the Website, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such User Submissions as permitted through the functionality of the Website and under these Terms of Service.

You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of User Submissions that have been removed or deleted. The above licenses granted by you in User Comments are perpetual and irrevocable.&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
I really like it when these paragraphs start with the helpful information that "you retain all ownership rights." Also note that YouTube points out that "You also hereby grant each user of the YouTube Website" some rights. Way to look out for the community. Good job. Now add the ability for us to put Creative Commons licenses on our videos somewhere other than in the description, okay? Thanks. &#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><h4 ><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=user_agreement&amp;trk=hb_ft_userag">LinkedIn's rights to your stuff</a>:</h4>&#13;

</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
LinkedIn is the one exception to the general conclusion I state above: its language about its rights to your content is at least as strong as Facebook's, if not more so. The thing is that people don't upload pictures and videos to LinkedIn; the main user-contributed content is the facts in a profile (where I worked, where I went to school). People usually don't mind having that information spread around. Also, you can tell that LinkedIn is thinking mainly about the suggestions for improvement that people submit ("ideas, concepts, techniques") -- but still, LinkedIn would be well-advised to revise. &#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><h4 ><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com/terms">Twitter's rights to your stuff</a>:</h4>&#13;

&#13;
   2. We encourage users to contribute their creations to the public domain or consider progressive licensing terms.&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
Isn't that sweet? Granted, the only stuff people contribute to Twitter are their little 140-character tweets, plus a profile pic or two -- these terms don't cover what you post to TwitPic, for instance. But Twitter wants you to know that your stuff is yours, and it wants you to share your stuff with others. Twitter doesn't reserve to itself the right to use your tweets in its promotional campaigns -- does Twitter even <!-- copied at 1 --><em >do</em> any self-promotion? They hardly need to; the <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://nytimes.com">New York Times</a> has certainly been giving them enough press lately.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Yeah, so I took the Facebook icon out of my Sociable WordPress widget. All my stuff here has a <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> license, so I've already allowed everyone including Facebook to use my stuff for "non-commercial" purposes anyway; it's not quite clear what counts as a "commercial" purpose in a Creative Commons license, granted (though they're working on clarifying the term), but any use that Facebook would make would probably be commercial. I don't even mind all commercial uses: I don't really care if they want to use my profile picture to show that the people who use Facebook are really sexy and good-looking. But the stuff on my blog does <!-- copied at 1 --><em >not</em> become Facebook "User Content" if I put a link that allows people to share it on Facebook. Come off it.&#13;

</div></div><div class="library-item"><h3 class="library-item-title">The Asimov story in which a mother invents Twitter</h3><div class="library-item-content"><!-- copied at 1 --><p >I was busy this morning seeing <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com/mrshmu">my mother</a> off after a weekend in which nothing, it seemed, could go wrong, and a great many things went startlingly, unexpectedly right. Thanks to <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com/grahamny">Graham "Sky" Rowat</a>, Mama and I got to go backstage last night after <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.guysanddollsbroadway.com/">Guys and Dolls</a>, which is something we'll both remember for a long, long time. Nothing like hanging out on an honest-to-goodness Broadway stage with the guy who's just given a terrific performance in the lead role. For once I got to give Mama something a little better than a <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.billy-collins.com/2005/06/the_lanyard.html">lanyard</a> in the usual wholly inadequate attempt at sufficient filial gratitude.  &#13;
&#13;
However, I've got a bit of Mother's Day left, and so there's still time to share with you all a little 1962 Isaac Asimov story called "<!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Son,_the_Physicist">My Son, The Physicist</a>," in which a mother invents <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>. Or sort of. &#13;
&#13;
The story isn't online anywhere; it's short enough for me to type the whole thing in for you -- it takes up only three and a half pages in the edition of <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32384&amp;referer=brief_results">Nightfall and Other Stories</a> that I got from the library -- but of course that'd be infringing copyright, so I won't. The gist is this: in the future, a mom comes to visit her hotshot son at "a huge government building" just as a furor has broken out. A space expedition has sent a communication from Pluto, the outermost, erm, dwarf planet, even though they were only supposed to get as far as Ganymede, Jupiter's largest moon, and even though the expedition left four years ago and only had enough supplies for a year. The eponymous physicist and some others believe that the expedition had help from extra-terrestrials, and so they're desperate to have a conversation with the folks on Pluto. &#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately, as the physicist explains, &#13;
&#13;
</p><!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >"At the present moment Pluto is just under four billion miles away. It takes six hours for radio waves, traveling at the speed of light, to reach from here to there. If we say something, we must wait twelve hours for an answer. If they say something and we miss it and say 'what' and they repeat -- bang, goes a day."</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
The physicist wants to get the Army's Multivac computer to solve the problem -- but instead, his sweet little old mother solves it for him in an instant: &#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >   "Just one moment, General," said Cremorna. "What are you getting at, Mother?"<!-- copied at 1 --><br/>&#13;
   "While you're waiting for an answer," said Mrs. Cremorna, earnestly, "just keep on transmitting and tell them to do the same. You talk all the time and they talk all the time. You have someone listening all the time and they do, too. If either one of you says anything that needs an answer, you can slip one in at your end, but chances are, you'll get all you need without asking."<!-- copied at 1 --><br/>&#13;
   Both men stared at her.&#13;
   Cremorna whispered, "Of course. Continuous conversation. Just twelve hours out of phase, that's all."</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
Of course. Continuous conversation. &#13;
&#13;
I went through a big Asimov phase in, oh, I don't even remember, but it was probably high school. I read <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/280874&amp;referer=brief_results"><!-- copied at 1 --><em>I, Robot</em></a> and a whole lot of short stories. I'm not sure what made me remember this story in particular, but it might have been the casual sexism, which I think I remember noticing with mild distaste even back then. It's a little retchy, Mrs. C's explanation of how she thought of continuous conversation:&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >"But Gerard, all women know it. Any two women -- on the videophone, or on the stratowire, or just face to face -- know that the whole secret to spreading the news is, no matter what, to Just Keep Talking."</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
Hkkkzh. As someone female who has always rather disliked both gossip and the telephone, I find this especially irritating. &#13;
&#13;
Ahem. I'm okay now, so now we can give Asimov his proper kudos for correctly predicting that continuous out-of-phase communication would become (how about that!) a great way of spreading the news. And while I'm not suggesting that Mrs. Stone or Mrs. Williams was the real brain behind Twitter, I still hope the <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/fashion/10nite.html?em">Twitter guys</a> gave their moms a nice Mother's Day.  </div></div><div class="library-item"><h3 class="library-item-title">Twitter, institutions, historians, audiences</h3><div class="library-item-content"><!-- copied at 1 --><p >Yesterday, Kathleen Hulser of the <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="https://www.nyhistory.org/web/index.html">New-York Historical Society</a> (yes, the hyphen is supposed to be there -- it's a <!-- copied at 1 --><em>historical</em> hyphen), who is writing an article for <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.historians.org/perspectives/"><!-- copied at 1 --><em>Perspectives on History</em></a>, the "newsmagazine of the American Historical Association," wrote me to ask, "How have social media blurred the boundaries between historian/institution and audience?" Here's a lightly-edited version of what I wrote. </p>&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><p>Sure, happy to answer. Being neither a historian (sorry!) nor an institution (not sorry!), I can't quite answer from either of those perspectives. But I do have a great deal to say about that blurring as an audience member for history, albeit a somewhat privileged and over-informed audience member who reads a great deal about and via social media and who is part of the "digital humanities" community.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><p>The short answer is that for me, social media have made both historians and institutions more human. I'll give you a couple of examples, both related to Twitter, which has dominated my own social media landscape in the past year. The first has to do with an institution: the Smithsonian. My mother and brother and I visited Washington DC last year and visited a couple of Smithsonian museums, and afterward, in a gift shop, I signed up for a subscription to <!-- copied at 1 --><em>Smithsonian</em> magazine. Recently I let that subscription lapse, because although I did enjoy the articles (I remember a great one about the historical evidence that Greek statues were painted), I didn't find one that I really liked often enough to justify the subscription. However, I've been <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com/smithsonian">following the Smithsonian on Twitter</a>, and if you visit that link you can easily see how much less formal the language is: <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com/smithsonian/status/1173097545">"The Smithsonian is playing head games again,"</a> for instance -- which, by the way, refers to an actual game that "The Smithsonian" is playing with its Twitter followers. There's clearly someone familiar with the <!-- copied at 1 --><em>tone</em> that's appropriate to social media behind the Smithsonian's Twitter account. I'd prefer it if the Smithsonian included that person's name, in fact, like the <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com/brooklynmuseum">Brooklyn Museum</a>  -- note how many more followers the Brooklyn Museum has, in fact: 15,694 to the Smithsonian's 1,794, and they've only been twittering a year longer. Note how much more often Shelley Bernstein replies to the Brooklyn Museum's followers, too -- that's a sure sign of engagement. But the Smithsonian is making a very good attempt, and when it broadcasts something that sounds interesting, it's a matter of a fraction of a second to click on the link and explore the Smithsonian's holdings. (I recently learned a bit about <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com/smithsonian/status/1174132255">stewardesses' uniforms</a> in the 60s and 70s -- those were some unbelievable hot pants and boots.) I get a similar feeling of serendipitous discovery as I did with the magazine, but at less cost to me in time and money.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><p>I've also gotten to know historians through Twitter, most notably <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com/dancohen">Dan Cohen</a>, whom I've still never met, but who broadcasts extremely useful information via Twitter almost every day -- and some less useful but still charming information, such as this nugget about the Victorians: <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com/dancohen/status/1175015394">"We historians of the Victorian era don't like to tell people our little secret: Victorians had bears, not dogs, as pets"</a>. We've exchanged messages about digital tools and issues, and I was particularly interested to read about his visit to the "Smithsonian 2.0" meeting, which I was able to <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23si20">track amazingly well via Twitter</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><p>The Smithsonian, Dan Cohen, and I are all equal entities on Twitter: when we "tweet" something interesting, people reply. Moreover, we all use Twitter as a place for both play and work, for broadcasting and receiving information -- and by "information," I mean knowledge and enjoyment. It feels very natural. </p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><p >A few further thoughts: it occurred to me that these examples (such as the hot pants) might actually serve to confirm the "anti-intellectualization" concern raised by an unnamed attendee at the Smithsonian 2.0 meeting. You can hear the incident discussed in the <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://digitalcampus.tv/2009/02/02/episode-37-material-culture/">latest episode</a> of the <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://digitalcampus.tv/">Digital Campus podcast</a>: someone (a curator?) worried about this anti-intellectual bent when shown that content on Flickr Commons includes such "wrong" tags as "guys with moustaches." And it's certainly true that the Smithsonian Twitter feed is no replacement for the magazine (though it's certainly a lot cheaper for the Smithsonian as well as for me), and that the money I've lately been giving to the Brooklyn Museum in admission and <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/join/1stfans/">1stfans membership</a> fees has a great deal to do with the fact that I now <!-- copied at 1 --><em>live</em> in Brooklyn. At some point it comes down to premises: is it a good thing for the Smithsonian and historians to be more accessible, meaning both more present online and more individual in tone? I believe it is.</p></div></div><div class="library-item"><h3 class="library-item-title">Where marketers would never want to tamper</h3><div class="library-item-content"><!-- copied at 1 --><p >Here's the thing: English professors don't usually get asked to test drive and review cars. I've reviewed books, grant proposals, even web sites. Never cars. &#13;
&#13;
Ah, this blessèd plot, this Internet. &#13;
&#13;
Granted, I'm not an "English professor" -- I have a Ph.D. in English literature, which means that I trained to become an English professor, but I've never made it even to the interview stage at the <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://mla.org/convention">MLA convention</a>. When people ask me what I do for a living, I often reply, "I have a Ph.D. in English literature." Which is dodging the question. If I feel obliged to say what I actually <!-- copied at 1 --><em>do</em>, I reply, "I work in various capacities on various projects having to do with technology and the humanities." Or, of course, I describe my current project and position. &#13;
&#13;
Really, I think, people expect an answer to the question of what I <!-- copied at 1 --><em>do</em> that identifies who I <!-- copied at 1 --><em>am</em>, an identity marker: "I am an assistant professor of English." Honestly, even when I had a one-year teaching position at North Carolina State University with the words "assistant professor" in the title, I never claimed that as an identity. I'd say, "I teach English literature at NC State," because I didn't have a <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenure">tenure-track</a> position. What I am, professionally speaking (besides perennially underemployed, which condition applies to at least <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.ade.org/reports/PHDPlacement.pdf">50%</a> of people with Ph.D.s in English literature) is still undefined. &#13;
&#13;
Sometimes this lack of definition is decidedly stressful -- I'd certainly like a permanent job with a permanent job title that I and others can immediately understand -- but at other times, times like these, it's actually kinda fun. I've never liked being categorized. ("Don't LABEL me, man," she said with a beatnik sneer.) I've been called a "poet" and a "musician" and a "singer-songwriter," and those labels never feel right, either. Those are just things I do sometimes, and they don't define me. "Grad student" was my label for a long time. I got used to that one, comfortable with it -- too comfortable. Recently I've claimed "digital humanist," though that term is arcane and <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://twitter.com/amandafrench/status/1201376131">hard</a> to <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://tapor.ualberta.ca/taporwiki/index.php/How_do_you_define_Humanities_Computing_/_Digital_Humanities%3F">define</a>. I define it as "someone with a <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities">humanities</a> degree who's interested in computers." &#13;
&#13;
Most recently, I earned another label: "blogger." Someone named "<!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://bit.ly/VTUjr">Blogger Amanda French</a>" was frequently cited in <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://blogs.usatoday.com/technologylive/2009/02/facebook-data-p.html">February's hoo-hah about Facebook's Terms of Service</a>. Facebook, by the way, has since asked its users to vote on the new Terms of Service, and they (<!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://consumerist.com/5222043/youre-participating-in-the-facebook-terms-of-service-vote-right">or some of them</a>, anyway) <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2009/04/24/facebook-terms-of-service-voting-ends-crowdsourced-terms-win/">approved the new ones</a>. Gotta be honest here: I don't much care. This was a good thing for Facebook to do, I think, and I'm especially glad as a former teacher of Intro to Composition that the new Terms are written in much clearer English. But who cares about my opinion? Not me. No pundit, I. I just like keeping up with technology news, and I do think that it's important for us all to keep an eye on the tech companies (and all companies), especially as regards intellectual property and privacy. &#13;
&#13;
What interested me about the controversy over Facebook's Terms of Service was simply whether or not it was justified -- whether or not <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://consumerist.com/5150175/facebooks-new-terms-of-service-we-can-do-anything-we-want-with-your-content-forever">the Consumerist's claims</a> that the Terms of Service were scary and horrible were true. That's what led me to <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://amandafrench.net/2009/02/16/facebook-terms-of-service-compared/">blog about it</a>. I concluded that yes, the Consumerist's claims or implied claims were pretty much true, and the hullabaloo  therefore just. &#13;
&#13;
I have reached, by the way, exactly the opposite conclusion about the swine flu hullabaloo, but fortunately there are already plenty of <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/apr/29/swine-flu-mexico-uk-media1">rational people</a> protesting this particular viral mania for misinformation. &#13;
&#13;
One label that I secretly like a lot and hope to deserve is "scholar," and that's what scholars do, I think: find out and tell the truth. Journalists do that too (ideally), but scholars get a lot more time to do it than journalists do, and scholars can seek out the truth about stuff that very few people care about at the moment. We scholars, bless us, can be as verbose and sesquipedalian as we like, and we can duck the current daily frenzy and spend our days humming through frenzies long turned to dust. That was my very favorite part of graduate school. While I was writing my <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://amandafrench.net/Dissertation.pdf">dissertation</a>, I got my investigation on, big time. Such fun. &#13;
&#13;
And then I also had fun finding a way to write the truth in a way that was accurate, fair, compassionate, and interesting. The trick is always to balance the desire to be witty or shocking or alliterative or otherwise attention-grabbing with the mandate to be correct and thorough and just. Get out of balance one way, and you've got a tabloid; get out of balance another, and you've got a 1040 form. As a scholar, I want to be, oh, let's pull a phrase out of the air, "engaging and authentic." &#13;
&#13;
All of which is a very long-winded way of getting around to telling you that since I've been christened a blogger, I am apparently entitled to receive e-mails such as this: &#13;
&#13;
</p><!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >"I see that you like to write and tweet about social media, teaching, and blogging, and I am wondering if you would like an opportunity to document the experience of test driving a roomy and sturdy Ford Mercury Milan or a sporty yet stylish Lincoln MKX for a few days? ItÃ¢ÂÂs usually the car journalists who get to test drive the cars, but weÃ¢ÂÂre looking for fresh perspectives and feedback, something a little more engaging and authentic. What do you think?"</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
I think I love the Internet. Hee hee.&#13;
&#13;
Ah, well. I told her that I was tickled by her offer (it still cracks me up), turned it down (politely, I hope), and warned her that I was going to write about her e-mail. I ought really to have sent her a link to technology journalist Rafe Needleman's <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://proprtips.com">Pro PR Tips</a> and a link to Merlin Mann's <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/merlin/2733259150/">correspondence with a hapless marketing intern</a>. Merlin Mann, who's one of the hilarities behind the podcast "<!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://youlooknicetoday.com">You Look Nice Today</a>," is neither a journalist nor a scholar and can thus pull out the snark bazooka.&#13;
&#13;
Analysis of this e-mail? First, the sender (or her boss) doesn't understand social media and should at once read the <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.cluetrain.com/book/95-theses.html">Cluetrain Manifesto</a>; second, she doesn't understand who I am, despite the presence of copious information on this site suggesting that I am not at all interested in cars or car reviewing; third, Ford might want to look for a new New Media marketing firm; fourth, she's being disingenuous to the point of dishonesty by writing that they're looking for "fresh perspectives and feedback." What led her to e-mail me, I know as surely as if I were kicked back with my feet up on her frontal lobe, was the fact that I have those 2,000 followers on Twitter and got those 30,000 views on that blog post about Facebook. Hey, look at me, I'm an influencer! Who needs a tenure-track job in an English department? &#13;
&#13;
Marketers, beware. I like what I like, and I write what I want to write, and I write it on my own schedule. I cannot be bribed. I cannot be persuaded. I have internal tenure, and you cannot take it from me. And I am not the only one, out here on this Internet. </div></div></div></div><div class="chapter" id="epub-chapter-4"><h2 class="anthologize-chapter-title">Chapter 4: Twitterstream</h2><div class="chapter-content"><div class="library-item"><h3 class="library-item-title">amandafrench: @briancroxall Shh.
